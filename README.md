Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Aaron, a 2nd year Computer Science student studying at Nottingham Trent University. I am a passionate developer aspiring to break into the world of data and artificial intelligence.

The evolution and possibilities of artificial intelligence is incredibly vast and expanding at an unprecedented rate. Every day, companies are battling in an arms race to monopolize the field and become the pioneers carrying the first torch. The future is here and I would love to take my part in paving its way.

I am currently looking for Summer internships for 2023!
