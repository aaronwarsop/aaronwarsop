Hello! 👋

Im Aaron, a 2nd year Computer Science student studying at Nottingham Trent University. I am a passionate young developer aspiring to become an experienced 
front-end developer/full stack engineer one day! I am also greatly interested in the progression of Artifical Intelligence as it is becoming more and more prevelant with each passing day. The future is coming and I would love to take my part in paving its way.

I am currently looking for Summer internships for 2023! Check out my portfolio here.
